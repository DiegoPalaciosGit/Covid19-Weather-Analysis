# Covid19-Weather-Analysis
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases and their correlation with meteorological variables in Guadalajara.

This study examines the potential relationship between COVID-19 cases reported at the Hospital General de Occidente in Guadalajara and temperature variations in the metropolitan area from 2020 to 2022. We explore how weather conditions may influence virus transmission and analyze whether there is a significant correlation between temperature, seasonal changes, and the spread of the virus in this region. Additionally, we consider social factors, including decisions made by the Secretaría de Educación Pública and the Guadalajara Government.

Our findings indicate a significant increase in cases during autumn and around the winter solstice, while temperature fluctuations throughout the year appear to be linked to case numbers. Holidays were identified as periods of increased vulnerability.
